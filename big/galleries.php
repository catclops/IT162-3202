<p>Web accessibility plays a vital role in the creation and presentation of image galleries on web browsers. As we delve more into the marriage between HTML and CSS it becomes evident that design and functionality also go hand in hand. A commonly believed logic is that images are bad for accessibility and alt text can already replace images with text for vision-impaired users. Of course, this logic extends to the idea that text-only sites are ideal for accessibility. However, this way of thinking is flawed since there are a variety of concepts that can only be demonstrated with the addition of visual stimuli such as illustrations, web animations, icons, color reliance, and contrast (WebAIM). An anatomy lesson, for example, clearly highlights the need for images since alt text would not fully cover the medical terms and named parts that a simple image could convey. CSS is the tool which will allow us to incorporate images into our web page.</p> 
<p>With CSS we can customize any display styles we wish for our uploaded image to incorporate as long as you specify the basic values. In order to get a properly functioning image gallery you would need to create a gallery in CSS with the element in a div container with a specified border. This would behave as a parent container and hold all of the images you wish to upload as long as you specify and incorporate a div class into the uploaded image code in HTML. Customization options go however you want when it comes to colors, border sizing, and image sizing. With a combination of @media queries and sensible values for the width and margin, you can literally specify how you want your images to look in your responsive image gallery. Any changes would go through CSS values and that would effect the entire gallery through the use of created div containers such as “responsive” and “gallery” in the site’s example (W3Schools).</p>    
<p>Once you come to understand and work with creating sufficient responsive image galleries then a whole new playing field opens up in the realm of web page design. It is always vital to incorporate the best lessons from web accessibility when it comes to designing a web page. A healthy mixture of aesthetic design with web accessibility standards is a perfect goal for any aspiring web developer to strive for in their field of expertise.</p>
