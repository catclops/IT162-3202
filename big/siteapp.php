<p>Businesses today need to tailor their applications toward the mobile market audience as there are more than 3.5 billion smartphone users throughout the world today (Babich). The only real choice a developer has in today's mobile and fast-paced world is whether to choose between creating a mobile app vs. a responsive web-based platform. In order to make a truly informed decision it is important to define what both platforms out and to explain the pros and cons of each.</p>
<p>A responsive web design is any site that shrinks to fit the size of your web browser window. The inherent pro is that an ideal site would look equally good on any media device from a smart phone through a tablet to a desktop. Another benefit is that all of the content is contained in one body which makes updates, edits, and deletions much easier since all you have to worry about is a single body. Responsive web pages have the edge in cross-platform accessibility and lowers the cost of production. However, all of these great benefits come with disadvantages such as limited responsive design on mobile platforms. Responsive designs require constant internet connectivity, have optimization issues, and do not support the bevy of mobile device features such as the camera and microphone (Enginess).</p>
<p>A mobile web design is specifically designed for mobile devices with considerations toward the platform’s limitations. It is necessary that content on this platform be easily readable, fast-loading, and accessible (Ghazaryan). Mobile sites will run faster on mobile phones and will vastly improve the user experience because all of the coding was designed with mobile users in mind. Another pro is that you have more freedom in design and personalization options that take advantage of the mobile hardware features. Mobile sites simply give more options when it comes to tailoring the user experience. However, all of these great benefits come at the cost of high maintenance due to the nature of maintaining two websites. You also have to factor in operating systems such as iOS and Android and the if you decide to run both, the production and resources cost factor increases exponentially.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is dependent on what type of app and what kind of customer base you are trying to target. Think of Responsive vs. Mobile apps as tools for a job you’re trying to accomplish and factor that into your decision. As long as web accessibility is prioritized behind the inherent design of your app, there can be no flaw in an informed decision.</p>
