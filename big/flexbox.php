<p>As we delve more into the intricacies of front end web page development, it is vital to take a look into the usage of flexboxes in order to be able to fully customize a web page layout. In the past, the only reliable methods for creating CSS layouts were the usage of floats and positioning. However, the issue of creating a layout that can be customized in regards to positioning, height, and width can be nearly impossible to achieve without the usage of the flexbox. </p>    
<p>A flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for aligning items in a row or column. These items can be “flexed” to fill in more space or be shrunk to reduce space. A CSS flexbox layout lets you format HTML through the conversion of a parent container into a flex container by adding the command display: flex; to the CSS of the parent container. In turn, this will change the container into a flex container and through additional lines of coding you can specify how you want your layout to align. Commands that follow after the display: flex such as flex-direction gives the user the tools to alter how they want the display of the child elements in the parent div container. Suppose you want the order to be arranged as a single column, flex-direction: column is the command that handles that. Suppose you want to reverse the display order in that column, flex-direction: column-reverse handles that. The trick of learning the lingo and playing around with these commands allow us to fully customize our page in a way that floats and positioning cannot handle.</p>    
<p>The previous examples are just a few of the several different options that flexboxes can give us. Since web accessibility is the focal point behind any well-designed web page, it is vital that a developer learns the concepts behind flexboxes in order to fulfill those web accessibility standards. Developers need to be able to have full control of how parent and child elements display on a web page in order to fulfill our goals of a web accessible application.</p>
